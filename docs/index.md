# KISS-prototype

## Introduction

In the KISS project, a modular framework is developed for simulation environmental flow problems.
Goal of the prototype project is to develop a fast, maintainable and well architected 2D hydrodynamic solver that mostly targets flooding applications (coastal and riverine).
The first prototype applications on this framework will, therefore, involve two-dimensional (2D), depth-averaged shallow-water applications.
